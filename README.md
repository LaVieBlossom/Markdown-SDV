	I can’t stop running. Tears are blurring my vision and my black gown is suffocating me but I keep pushing forward. The cold winter’s breeze wraps around me sending a haunting chill through my body. The rain is streaming down my face mixing with my own tears until I can no longer tell the difference. Feeling alone and utterly distraught, my body is numb and all I can do is put one foot in front of the other. I don’t know where I’m heading but I charge forward thinking maybe, just maybe I can shake the overwhelming loneliness enveloping me like an oversized sweater.  But no matter how far I go she will never come back to me. The realisation knocks me down. I’m alone in this world and I must find a way to make it on my own.
